Design

Mobile-friendliness: you don't need advanced responsive styles, but you should ensure that your portfolio page is still readable on different screen sizes
Readability: make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.

Suggested: Update Portfolio -- Employer Competitive

At least 3 deployed projects

External content:

Update your LinkedIn with the projects you've worked on so far
Update the README for each project you linked to with a description of the problem,
how you solved it, and some information about your technical approach
Suggested: refactor some of your code from earlier assignments to make them more readable

Competitive Design

Mobile-first design: you should be proud to pull out your phone and share
your portfolio site with a friend, family member, or someone at a meetup.
Polish: choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like
the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.
Images: add a meaningful screenshot for each of your projects
